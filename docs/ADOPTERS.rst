The Jenkins Templating Engine started out as a framework developed by `Booz Allen Hamilton <https://boozallen.com>`_
as part of the Solutions Delivery Platform.  JTE has unified Booz Allen's approach to implement DevSecOps practices
at scale across many different client environments.

The `Solutions Delivery Platform <https://boozallen.github.io/sdp-docs>`_ consists of the Jenkins Templating Engine, a portfolio of `open source pipeline libraries <https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-libraries>`_,
and the Infrastructure as Code for several different reference architecutres to quickly standup a DevSecOps platform.
