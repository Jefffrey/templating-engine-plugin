= Individual Pipeline Jobs

The most straight forward way test out a pipeline template is to create a Pipeline job in Jenkins.

== Select the Jenkins Templating Engine Pipeline Definition Option

A `Jenkins Templating Engine` pipeline definition is made available once the plugin is installed. 

== Configure the Pipeline

After selecting the `Jenkins Templating Engine` definition, you'll be able to configure your *Pipeline Template* and *Pipeline Configuration*. 

== The Example

The example configuration above assumes you have configured a *Library Source* that has a `maven` and `sonarqube` library contributing the `unit_test`, `build`, and `static_code_analysis` steps.

The pipeline configuration defines a *Stage* called `continuous_integration` which invokes the steps defined, in order.

Then, in the *Pipeline Template*, you will be able to invoke the `continuous_integration` stage that was defined.
